## Case Story

### Navigating SOX compliance in a dynamic business environment

Our client, a renowned publishing education and research company with a rich legacy of over 200 years, faced the challenge of maintaining a robust SOX compliance program amid rapid growth and frequent acquisitions. With over $2 billion in revenues, the company needed a fresh perspective to ensure their compliance efforts kept pace with their evolving business landscape

### Transforming compliance for agility and efficiency

The client previously relied on a Big 4 firm to manage their SOX program but found traditional approaches lacking in agility and cost-effectiveness. Bough was engaged to take over the SOX program, bringing in fresh perspectives, tailored strategies, and efficient solutions to align with the client’s rapidly changing operational needs.

### Revitalizing the SOX program with an adaptive approach

Bough deployed an agile and cost-effective SOX solution designed to cater to the client's dynamic business needs and objectives.
