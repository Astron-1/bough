## Case story

### Trouble on all fronts

Our client is a global technology company with revenues of over $3 billion and is a leading provider of contact center, unified communications and networking products and services.

Our client was required to adopt the new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606) and as a result, needed to transform its accounting and financial reporting process to meet the new requirements. With uncertainty around implementation of their initial plan, Bough was called upon, one month before the ‘go-live’ date of the initial solution, to implement an alternate solution to meet the Q1 fiscal deadline.

### Partnering for success

In view of the client’s existing data and time limitations, Bough was entrusted in delivering the following:

* Conceptualize the end-to-end revenue accounting solution
* Complete build, UAT and deployment for the accounting solution
* Design and finalize new processes and controls
* Project Management Support
* Manage change, conduct trainings, and build organizational awareness
* Operationalize and manage the new process
* Achieve audit readiness for the Q1 close

Bough offered the technical expertise, guidance, and systematic breakdown of expectations / requirements to enable IT to effectively use their knowledge of enterprise systems, technology, processes, and data to achieve the end goal.

### Capitalizing on existing and newly developed synergies

Bough owned the overall process and engaged with stakeholders to identify pain points and opportunities. We worked closely with business IT to deliver the technology functionality and provide integration capabilities that included: developing a data warehouse; integrating critical systems; and creating a single source of truth.

**Cross functional stakeholder engagement and leadership**

Bough's project leadership included engaging cross-functional stakeholders to understand their needs, identifying quick wins, and implementing a 'strawman' strategy for precise execution of the new accounting solution

Ensuring all key data in one place, i.e., the data warehouse that stored ~80% of all enterprise revenue transactions (transactions not covered were the non- ASC 606 impacting e.g., recurring revenues), enabled us to pull in the requisite information efficiently into our accounting solution to calculate revenues and post journal entries
